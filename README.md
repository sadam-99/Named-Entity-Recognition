# Named-Entity-Recognition
Implemented Named entity recognition (NER) which is a sub-task of information extraction (IE) that seeks out and categorises specified entities in a body or bodies of texts. NER is also simply known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction. NER is used in many fields in Artificial Intelligence (AI) including Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.
In this project we extractd theb following entities:

geo = Geographical Entity
org = Organization
per = Person
gpe = Geopolitical Entity
tim = Time indicator
art = Artifact
eve = Event
nat = Natural Phenomenon
The dataset follows a BIO type tagging.
